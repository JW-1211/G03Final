    - 1. As you share your story, explain your reasoning behind it! Describe why you think this happened.
    - 2. What are some notable events in your story? Make sure to put in emphasis when you get to the important part.
    - 3. Last but not least - after you've finished sharing, don't forget to ask for peer feedback from your classmates! Brainstorming as a group is a great way to exercise creativity, and make sure that you haven't left any mistakes lying around.
